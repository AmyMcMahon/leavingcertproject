			<h2>Brief:</h2>
			<p>My project meets all requirements of the brief. It is a stand-alone device and once started it can measure rainfall automatically. An alarm is triggered when the rain sensor records a value less than 1000. The data is sent to Firebase where it is configured in a graph. The rainfall can be monitored from anywhere with an internet connection through the website.</p>
			<h2>Challenges:</h2>
			<p>I ran into a few challenges linking my device to Firebase and to the website which I have discussed in my Implementation and Testing Section. I was able to solve any challenges I encountered. I was able to draw on my previous experience of using Firebase and also on online resources and tutorials.</p>
			<h2>Design Objectives:</h2>
			<p>I was able to include all elements I had planned for my device in the finished product. I also decided to add an audio alarm I had not previously included as it would make the device more inclusive. </p>

			<h2>Future Expansion + Modification:</h2>
			<p>To further expand my project, I would enhance my device so it sends a message via the internet to the user, perhaps using IFTTT, alerting them of rainfall. Granny would find this very useful as it would alert her to bring in the washing from the clothesline if it starts raining. Although a buzzer sounds when there is rainfall, Granny doesnâ€™t always hear it. <br/><br/>
				Additionally, the project could be modified to be part of a plant watering system that operates based on the amount of rainfall over a period. If there is no rainfall for a certain number of days adding a motor and water supply could provide water to a plant. This would be beneficial for users, like granny, who may be away from home for several days.

			<h2>Initial Research</h2>
			<p>Upon receiving the brief, I began researching smart home automation systems. Systems I was already
			familiar with included Google Nest, Ring Security Cameras, and heating control systems. Smart home
			technology enhances people’s lives e.g., convenience, safety, and energy-management. These technologies
			are accessible by a diverse range of people e.g., elderly people living alone, families with young 
			children, and people with disabilities. Other smart home devices I discovered during my research 
			included smart pet feeders, video doorbells and smart light bulbs</p>

			<h2>Potential Solutions</h2>
			<p>I researched several embedded systems that could feature as part of a smart home automation system. 
			I brainstormed distinct aspects of home life that could be automated, making living spaces more 
			enjoyable. Three systems I analysed in-depth were:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Rain-sensing system</li>
				<li>Smart fans</li>
				<li>House alarm systems</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A <strong>rain-sensing system</strong>, used to detect rainfall, can solve problems such as over-watering of plants and gardens. They can be used by crop growers to aid water conservation. Rain sensors are widely used in the automobile industry to detect rainfall on windscreens, turning on wipers automatically at appropriate speeds.<a href="References.html" id="inlineLink">[1]</a></p>

			<p>I also analysed <strong>smart fan automation systems</strong> that sense room temperature and turns on/off when the temperature exceeds or drops below a specific value. Smart fans are widely used in homes and industry. They ensure comfortable room temperatures and increase energy-efficiency by slowing down or switching off as required, unlike traditional fans. Research indicates smart fans can be expensive and complex to install. <a href="References.html" id="inlineLink">[2]</a></p>

			<p>Finally, I researched a <strong>smart house alarm system</strong>. These systems use a selection of wireless technologies, mobile phones, motion sensors and cameras to enable homeowners provide greater protection for their homes in comparison to traditional home alarms. The system can be conveniently controlled from anywhere via a mobile phone. Research indicates a reliable internet connection is essential.<a href="References.html" id="inlineLink">[3]</a></p>

			<h2>Final Choice:</h2>
			<p>For this project I decided to develop a rain-sensing system. My granny has often worried about over-watering her plants, particularly if she has been away for a few days and doesn’t know how much rainfall there has been. <br/><br/>
			I rejected the idea of a house alarm system and the smart fan as many of these devices already exist for affordable prices and granny already has these systems in her home. Based on a further deep-dive into rain-sensing systems. <br/><br/>
			I concluded the following for my project:</p><br/>

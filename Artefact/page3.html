				<h2>What Is A Rain Sensor?</h2>
				<p>A Rain Sensor is a device that detects rainfall and can notify you when it begins to rain. The rain board operates as a variable resistor: resistance increase when 
				the sensor is wet, and resistance decreases when it is dry. This value is then outputed to the Micro:bit device <br/><br/> Rain Sensors have a wide 
				variety of uses such as automatic irrigation systems and automatic wipers in a car. A Rain Sensor can also be extremely 
				beneficial if you have washing on the line and are concerned about the rain! It is also useful if you want to track how much water
				your plants are getting when you are away from home!<br/><br/> AutoHomes aims to provide the highest quailty
				Rain Sensors to households and businesses all around Ireland. Our Rain Sensors detect rainfall and trigger an alarm so that you are 
				aware of the rain. The rainfall on your own Rain Sensor can be monitored throghout the day on our website. <br/><br/>The data we collect will be not be stored to ensure
				there is not risk of a data leak. The data will only be used for its intended purpose. It is important you do not remove the device from the protective casing, as there is a risk the rain could damage the device.
